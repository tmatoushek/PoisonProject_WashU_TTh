WU Data BootCamp Project 1; Missouri Poison Center Data 

Project Title: Missouri Poison Center health data analysis and review of pertinent data in the Missouri Public Health Information  System (MOPHIMS) 
 
Team members: Nick Bergfeld, Courtney Charles, Tom Matoushek

Data: MOPHIMS

Missouri Poison Center Mission: "Protect Missourians from poison incidence by providing emergency assistance and expertise, preventative education, advocacy and research."

Business Need: Missouri Poison Center has working and reference data bases that it uses in its' daily mission of serving parents, educators and healthcare professionals. There are other data sets that have pertinent information of interest to the MPC. However, the center does not have the resources, budget or time to adequately explore them.  

Project Goal: To provide the Missouri Poison Center with an overview analysis of data from the Missouri Public Health Information  System (MOPHIMS) pertinent to MPC's mission. MPC staff will then be able to compare Missouri public data with MPC internal data to assess if MPC services are being utilized at optimal levels across the state of Missouri

Hypothesis: Is the poison center underutilized in MO counties?
Null Hypothesis: The poison center is being optimally utilized in MO counties.

Focus of Analysis:
Child poisonings (under 15)
By Types of poisonings
	Household
	alcohol and substance abuse, 
	accidental drug poisonings, 
	opioid abuse/deaths, and 
	carbon monoxide 
By County 
By Age Group
By private insurance vs public insurance vs self pay
By general access to medical care across Missouri
(do areas with less access to medical care also have larger numbers of poisonings?)
